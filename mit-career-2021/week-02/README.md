### MIT Lab Week 2

# Name

Console Table Lab Week 2

# Description

This project is supposed to be challenging and useful for people learning javascript.<br/><br/>

As we are currently in Week 2 of our Full Stack Development Professional Certificate, 
we were proposed to build a simple welcome page for this section (index.html) and generate rounded figures which bounce in the screen.<br/><br/>

It was build using plain javascript, and only used jQuery for animating the movement to make it a little smoother.
