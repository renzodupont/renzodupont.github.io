Real Time Bus Tracker

# Description

This project shows the current place of each bus which travels between MIT and Harvard using the MBTA API. More information in https://api-v3.mbta.com/ - It uses a refresh rate of 15 seconds to avoid being banned.

while learning to manipulate Map layers using Mapbox.
