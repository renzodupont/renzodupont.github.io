### MIT Lab Week 5

# Name

Top Salaries from JSON Source Lab Week 5

# Description

This project is supposed to be challenging and useful for people learning javascript.<br/><br/>

As we are currently in Week 5 of our Full Stack Development Professional Certificate,
we were proposed to use a JSON with over 20k records to identify people with top 5 salaries, and people with salary over 200k.<br/><br/>

It was build using plain javascript.
