### MIT Lab Week 1

# Name

How to setup Github Pages Lab Week 1

# Description

This project is suppose to help introducing anyone without any experience to Github Pages.<br/><br/>

As we are currently in Week 1 of our Full Stack Development Professional Certificate, 
we were proposed to create out own Github Repository and try to explain the process to someone else with a simple page.<br/><br/>

There is no javascript in this stage, only HTML. For CSS, I used Bootstrap for easy setup.
