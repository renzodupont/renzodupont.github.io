### MIT Lab Week 7

# Name

Test Suites with JestJS

# Description

This project is supposed to be challenging and useful for people learning javascript.<br/><br/>

As we are currently in Week 7 of our Full Stack Development Professional Certificate,
we were are learning to create Test Suites for our code using JestJS.<br/><br/>

The example shows a simple calculator.js file and the corresponding test.js file for it.<br/><br/>
We also got some requirements to build a greet.js file and corresponding tests.
