### MIT Lab Week 8

# Title

Moving eyes in a Minecraft like Homer MIT Lab Week 8

# Description

This project is supposed to be challenging and useful for people learning javascript, created as part of one of our assignments during the Full Stack Development career in 2021.

The page generates a Minecraft looking Homer Simpson which follows your mouse movements with its eyes. Homer will also close its eyes every now and then (like we all need to do, right?), and there is a small animation in the sky tribute to a memorable character of the series.

It was build using plain javascript. JQuery was used only for basic animations.
