### MIT Lab Week 3

# Name

Console Table Lab Week 3

# Description

This project is supposed to be challenging and useful for people learning javascript.<br/><br/>

As we are currently in Week 3 of our Full Stack Development Professional Certificate, 
we were proposed to print a well formatted table in the console. The table contains the multipliers from 1 to 10.<br/><br/>

It was build using plain javascript.
