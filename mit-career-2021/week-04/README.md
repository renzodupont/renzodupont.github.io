### MIT Lab Week 4

# Name

Pac Man Lab Week 4

# Description

This project is supposed to be challenging and useful for people learning javascript.<br/><br/>

As we are currently in Week 4 of our Full Stack Development Professional Certificate,
we were proposed to simulate the Pac Mac game character movement in the screen.<br/><br/>

It was build using plain javascript, and only used jQuery for animating the movement to make it a little smoother.
