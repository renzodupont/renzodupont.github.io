                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>I also was new creating a website in Github and had a lot of questions. 
                       I hope to cover the most common issues and steps so you can setup your own site!</p>
                    <p>You can always reach me via <a href="https://instagram.com/renzodupont" target="_blank">instagram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/renzodupont.com" target="_blank">twitter</a>.</p>
                    <p><i>For this site I have used Bootstrap and jQuery to help organize the info without worrying too much about styling.</i></p>
                </div>

            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-heading">Getting a Github Account</div>
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>If you are not part of Github yet, go and create an account <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                       You can get an account for free and fairly easy. Choose a username that is meaningful for you or your organization.</p>
                    <p>A repository is the space where you will store all the files needed for your website to work. It also provides version control using GIT. With <b>Github pages</b>, you also get the ability to share your site with the public quick and easy.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-heading">Now the fun starts</div>
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>Once you have your account, it's time to create your first repository. Since we want to use this repository as a public site, we need to follow the next convention:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The repository name must be <b><i>yourusername</i>.github.io</b> - for example, mine is renzodupont.github.io</li>
                        <li>The repository is exactly the same as any other, so you can clone it, configure privacy, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <img src="img/newrepo.png" width="100%" />
                    <br/><br/>
                    <p><b><i>Please note that in the next image, you will see the message <i style="color:red;">"The repository already exists"</i>. This is because I already have a repo with this name, this won't happen to you.</i></b></p>
                    <img src="img/reponame.png" width="100%" />
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-heading">You can start playing</div>
                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>Now that you have your repository, anything in this space will be available to the public via the URL of the repo.</p>
                    <p>For example, my repo is available at <a href="http://renzodupont.github.io" target="_blank">renzodupont.github.io</a>, which is the name I chose earlier.</p>
                    <p>By default, the root document (what you first see when you go to the site) is the file called index.html</p>
                    <p><b>Please note that it might take some minutes for configuration to take place. If you go to your website and get a 404 error, wait at least 15 minutes and try again.</b></p>

                    <br/><br/>
                    <p>In order to add files to your repo, you can create a file called index.html in your computer and then upload it using the "Add File" button which is visible in the image.</p>
                    <p>Another alternative is to clone this repository using GIT into your computer and add any files you need. For this you will need some basic background on how to use GIT commands.</p>
